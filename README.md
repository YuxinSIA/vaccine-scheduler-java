# vaccine-scheduler-java

A common type of application that connects to a database is a reservation system, where users schedule time slots for some centralized resource. 

This is the repo for the implementation of an appointment scheduler for vaccinations, where the users are patients and caregivers keeping track of vaccine stock and appointments. This application will run on the command line terminal, and connect to a database server in Microsoft Azure.
